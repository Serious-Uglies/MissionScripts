If you wish to create your own templates, Create a new mission and place the aircraft onboard your 
desired ship. Insure they are named as something useful to help you identify them later.

Open the Units List, sort by Unit ID desending

Open the .miz mission file with winzip / 7zip

Open the Mission file with something like notepad or your prefered software.

Press control F to open search and enter ["unitId"] = ##, Where ## is the id of the unit you wish to copy
(ideally you should start with the lowest number of those you wish to copy)

Cross reference the Unit list in the editor to your ID's shown in the mission file to confirm exactly 
what unit you've got

Create a new .lua file for the template, save it.
Open the template spawn example, copy the code.

Copy and paste relevant details above the unit ID over the section you need to change.

Copy and paste a new copy of this segment and repeat as needed.

Save.

In mission, Set Flag 404 to the ship id you're using
AFTER this (give it a second or two delay) run the script file you created to spawn the created template.

Don't forget to re-open the script file if you're making changes, the editor saves a copy when opened.
